Generics -> parameterized types. to allow type and userdefined types to be a parameter to methods, classes and
interfaces. possible to create classes that work with different data types.

Why generics -> object is the superclass of all other classes, and can refer to any object. these features 
lack type safety. generics add that type of safety feature.

types of generics -> 
Generic method: method takes a parameter and returns some value after performing a task. 

Generic classes -> implemented exactly like a non-generic class. only difference is that it contains a type 
parameter section.
