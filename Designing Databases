Caching -> Redis, memcache

Remote Dictionary server -> key value store
used to boost speed for mysql queries at scale, became famous because it is a cache, which can be used as a persistent data store.

Blob Store -> Object Store to store files that can be served when required directly

Text Searching Engine -> SOLR, Elastic Search 
this is essentially not a database, and can't be called as a persistent data store
gives the capability of faster reads due to indexing, and fuzzy searches. Faster than a trad database

Time Series Databases :-> 
When we're building a application metric tracking system such as Grafana, prometheus

We'll need something called as a time series database.
Extension of RDBMS

Appended write mode -> since its a sequential database store rather than a random query store. this is
essentially a appeneded write mode db as the data would come from an ever increasing timestamp

Bulk read -> reading time series data to build metrics tracking or analysis would mean that we would need bulk reading capabilities.

Data warehouse -> large data stores used as a dump to store all the data, upon which analytics can happen to make reports and multiple analytics tools can 
be used to process this large chunk of data is known as a data warehouse
for example -> Hadoop, Snowflake are some data warehouse
snowflake -> 
cloud computing based data warehouse

NoSQL vs SQL databases -> 
Structured Data

ACID required : YES / NO

use RDBMS -> Postgres, MySQL, Oracle

Non Structured data 

If ++Datatypes && ++Queries ->
  increasing data types to include more hierarchies and nestings
  and multiple types of queries 
  for example -> amazon storing information, for new products and adding new subtypes and product info metadata
  
  use Document DB
 Use MongoDB, CouchDB
 
if Ever increasing data && finite queries 
  Uber drivers accumalating location information for every ride
  
use Columnar DB
  use Cassandra, HBase
